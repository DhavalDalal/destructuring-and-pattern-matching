# Destructuring and Pattern Matching

Destructuring and Pattern Matching in various FP languages.  

* Most functional programming languages provide some level of de-structuring.  Destructuring gives you a short-hand way of naming and getting the innards of the structure.  

* The difference between destructuring and pattern matching is that in Pattern matching, we are not only matching on relative positions of elements in the data-structure, but also trying to dispatch to different functions based on the value inside the data structure.  This dispatch is a kind of conditional construct, while in destructuring there is nothing conditional about it.  So, Pattern matching is about associating a function with a particular set of inputs.  So, we can have many such functions for inputs that we destructure on.
