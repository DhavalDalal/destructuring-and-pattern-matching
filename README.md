# Destructuring and Pattern Matching

Destructuring and Pattern Matching in various FP languages

* Destructuring gives you a short-hand way of naming the parts of the structure and picking apart parts of the structure.  

* The difference between destructuring and pattern matching is that in Pattern matching, we are not only matching on relative positions of elements in the data-structure, but also trying to dispatch to different functions based on the value inside the data structure.  Its about associating a function with a particular set of inputs.  So, we can have many such functions for inputs that we destructure on.

This was one of the melodies that Ryan Lemmer and myself for the Code Jugalbandi - [http://codejugalbandi.org](http://codejugalbandi.org).
