Problem Statement:

How will you enhance this code to include drawing these objects on?
* OpenGL
* Direct3D

Possible Solutions:

* Introduce drawOpenGL() and drawDirect3D() methods in Shape3d. 
  * We have now made shapes aware of the "drawing platform" specific code.  Though they are drawable objects, but how to draw would be present inside them.
  * It does not scale to more drawing platforms.  We have to add to hierarchy everytime.

* Use Visitor Pattern
